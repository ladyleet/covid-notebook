### Crispy Pork Belly ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

The easiest way to make crispy pork belly. This method is as simple as it gets. Doesn't require mountains of salt and you don't need to dry out the skin in the fridge for 12-24 hours like a lot of other recipes tell you to do.

Perfectly light & crispy skin pork belly everytime!

Things you'll need:

1~1.5kg fresh pork belly
A little salt
Pot with boiling water
An air fryer

Method:

Fresh pork belly is best. Boil for 40mins, remove and rest.
Pat belly dry and preheat air fryer at 200c.

Using a fork, poke a gazillion holes in the skin. When you think you have poked enough holes, poke some more.

Flip and cut a few slits 3/4 way through the meat. Season with salt and any other spices you want.

Flip back over and pat the skin as try as possible. Lightly season with salt and place in air fryer at 200c.

Roast for 40mins or until golden and crispy.

Rest for a few mins, portion up and enjoy!

A detailed video and step by step guide available here:

Give this a go! Juicy and very crispy every time!

NOTE: forgot to mention in the video but make sure you place air fryer by an open window as the skin will pop causing fat to touch the heating element which will cause a little smoke. It's completely normal for it to pop, so don't be alarmed when it happens.

### Artichoke and Sun Dried Tomato Ziti

1/4 LB of Ziti
3/4 C of Canned Artichoke Hearts, cut in 1x1 inch squares (approximately)
1/8 C of Sun Dried Tomato, roughly chopped
Approx 16 fl oz Chicken Stock
2 t salt
Black pepper to taste
1/8 C of Basil, roughly chopped
1/4 C Parmesan, grated

Put chicken stock, salt, and ziti in a saucepan or shallow pot. The ziti should basically be just covered, about 1/2 inch of stock above the ziti. Let boil for about 12 minutes, or until al dente.

Stir in the sun dried tomato and continue to let reduce until there is only enough liquid to coat the pasta. It should become a thicker liquid, but not too thick.

Then, stir in the artichokes and add the parmesan; keep stirring.

When the texture of the sauce feels right to you, add in the basil.

Taste, and adjust for flavor with salt and pepper and serve!
